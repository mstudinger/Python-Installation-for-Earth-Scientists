Managing Python™ packages can be a daunting task. Often, numerous incompatibilities exist between commonly used Python™ packages in Earth sciences (see example about GDAL and Xarray in Jupyter notebook). This repository contains a Jupyter notebook with instructions for installing essential Python™ packages for Earth scientists and testing the functionality of the installed packages. The Jupyter notebook has the advantage that individual cells can be run depending on which packages are installed. The Jupyter notebook and corresponding Python™ script have been tested under:  
* Windows 11 Pro (23H2)        Python™ 3.11.7
* Windows 10 Enterprise (21H2) Python™ 3.9.13
* Linux Ubuntu 22.04.2 on WSL2 Python™ 3.11.7 (selected elements)
