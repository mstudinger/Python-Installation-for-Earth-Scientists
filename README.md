Managing Python™ packages can be a daunting task. Often, numerous incompatibilities exist between commonly used Python™ packages in Earth sciences (see example about GDAL and Xarray in Jupyter notebook). This repository contains a Jupyter notebook with instructions for installing essential Python™ packages for Earth scientists and testing the functionality of the installed packages. The [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/mstudinger/Python-Test-Tools/blob/main/python_installation_instructions_and_verification.ipynb) has the advantage that individual cells can be run depending on which packages are installed. The Jupyter notebook and corresponding Python™ script have been tested under the following environments:  
* Windows 11 Pro (23H2)        Python™ 3.11.7
* Windows 10 Enterprise (21H2) Python™ 3.9.13
* Linux POSIX Release: 5.15.146.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 Python™ 3.11.7
* Linux POSIX Release: 5.10.198-187.748.amzn2.x86_64 Python™ 3.11.8 (selected packages tested on the [CryoCloud JupyterHub](https://cryointhecloud.com))
